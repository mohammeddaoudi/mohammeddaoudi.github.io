      <description>&lt;p&gt;Reconstructing, characterizing, and understanding the shape and motion of individuals or groups of people have many important applications, such as ergonomic design of products, rapid reconstruction of realistic human models for virtual worlds, and an early detection of abnormality in predictive clinical analysis. Naturally, the capture and analysis of peopleâ€™s shape and motion have a long tradition in disciplines such as computer vision, computer graphics, and virtual reality. This is evidenced by the large amount of research done on shape reconstruction from images and 3D scans, on subspace construction with multiple shapes, on motion capture and action recognition from video inputs. However, most current techniques treat shape and motion independently, with devoted techniques for either shape or motion in isolation. This is largely due to the difficulty of acquiring proper observations on full moving shapes: Traditional systems have been devoted to capture either static shapes, e.g. 3D scanners, or motion only, e.g. motion capture.
Recent evolutions in the technology for capturing moving shapes have changed this paradigm with new multi-view acquisition systems that enable now full 4D models of human shapes including geometry, motion and appearance, as in Microsoft, Inria, MPI, or more recently with commercial platforms deployed by Intel, 8i or Microsoft, among others. Such data open new possibilities and challenges for the analysis and the synthesis of human shapes in motion that are yet largely unexplored but would be of benefit to a wide range of applications in virtual and augmented reality, or in the sport and medical domains, among others. This is especially true with the rapidly growing VR/AR immersive applications based on head mounted displays, which require realistic and detailed models to improve the immersive experience. Magic leap, Microsoft Hololense, Facebook Oculus Rift, Sony PS4 HMD and the HTC Vive, among others, are clear examples of this recent and rapid evolution and the associated need to produce adapted realistic contents. In the future we will be able to make digital copies of moving persons using a handy imaging device, send them over the network, make customized compositions of digital 4D human shapes, etc. Human4D will participate to this evolution with objectives that can profoundly improve the reconstruction, transmission, and reuse of digital human data, by unlocking the limited use of deep learning techniques in human shape modeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Human4D project aims at investigating some of these issues with a particular emphasis on how to represent a collection of 4D data in an efficient and compact way, as required by advanced applications such as statistical analysis or motion synthesis. Our ambition is to go beyond existing shape space representations that mostly focus on static shape poses, and seldom consider the continuous dynamic of shapes. Although all these ideas exist already and are not novel per say, no existing work has achieved a similar goal. Indeed, the complexity and persistent change in geometry and topology of such time-varying data make most traditional shape analysis algorithms unsuitable. This project is timely, as shown by important ongoing research activities in this field in both the academia and the industry (as mentioned previously). It gathers French research teams with long-standing expertise in the field, associated with one of a few acquisition platforms available worldwide that can produce the required data on moving human bodies.&lt;/p&gt;
